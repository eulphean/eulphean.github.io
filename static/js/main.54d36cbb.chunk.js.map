This website is an up-to-date repository of my most recent creative inquiries. My artistic pursuit is a tool for inquiring, experimenting, and playing with subject matter that is concerned with the state of \"being\" and \"time\". It attempts to deconstruct the human condition by exploring themes of impermanence and unpredictability through the lens of temporality. Every creative act is like an event unfolding in space & time - an organic synthesis of philosophical research, historical excavation, and scientific exploration, in tandem with creative experimentation with technology. By utilizing the craft of code, algorithms, and computer-aided tools, my works contrive systemic metaphors, which superimpose physical and digital materialities.</span>\nconst maxInputLength = 50;

It's prepared using a precise genetic computation algorithm that organizes the information in discrete hierarchical order, which can be looked from top (left) to bottom (right) or bottom (right) to top (left). Every direction invokes a unique sense of perception. A top-down approach is a combination of parts into a whole, whereas a bottom-up approach is a disintegration of the whole into its parts. Each unit of information (reprsented by a colored quad) behaves as a part and a hole simultaneously - a phenomenon Koestler famously described as a Holon (Whole-Part).

The title of the workshop along with all the historical material was borrowed from the book \"The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art\" by Linda Dalrymple Henderson. On the first day, I introduced the participants to Augmented Reality with SparkAR as one of the tools to mediate higher dimensions. Along with the historical development of this idea, we conducted a visual and spatial deconstruction of a tesseract using an <CustomLink to='https://amaykataria.com/Tesseract/' inline={true}>interactive</CustomLink> tool that I developed to better the understand the fourth dimension. The second day was discursive and led by the participants. Every one of them brought a previous project, thoughts, questions, and insights about the fourth dimension, which were expanded and discussed collaboratively. The seminar was mediated by Zoom and was attended by eight selected students across art & design programs in the most reputed colleges in India.
